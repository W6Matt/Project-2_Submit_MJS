Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
    The code could have used more comments
  
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are 
you adding to your support network?
     The code was not particular difficult to write, I did keep optimizing the code, so there were many revisions.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
    Utilizing multiple languages in a single project I think will be key in my career, 
    using the best language for the task at hand make fast and reliable code. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    By creating a git hub repository, I was able to work between multiple computers
